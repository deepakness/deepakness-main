title: Cloudflare Pages - All Set to Beat Netlify
description: Cloudflare Pages is launched. And, it's going to give tough
  competition to Netlify.

Netlify is the first choice for most developers when it comes to hosting static sites and web applications.

Not anymore!!!

With the most generous free tier, **Cloudflare Pages** is all set to compete with Netlify on this front. And, I believe, it can be the next number 1 choice to host JAMstack sites.

Cloudflare Pages offer default `pages.dev` URL whereas Netlify offers `netlify.app`. Meaning, if you're not willing to add a custom domain to your app, it will look something like `your-github-repo.pages.dev`in Cloudflare Pages.

However, Netlify lets you change the default subdomain name.

That's it.

Let's see what happens to the Cloudflare Pages in the near future.
