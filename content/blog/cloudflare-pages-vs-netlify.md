Netlify is the first choice for most developers when it comes to hosting static sites and web applications.

Not anymore!!!

With the most generous free tier, **Cloudflare Pages** is all set to compete with Netlify on this front. And, I believe, it can be the next number 1 choice to host JAMstack sites.

Cloudflare Pages offer default `pages.dev` URL whereas Netlify offers `netlify.app`. Meaning, if you're not willing to add a custom domain to your app, it will look something like `your-github-repo.pages.dev` in Cloudflare Pages.

However, Netlify lets you change the default subdomain name.

That's it.

Let's see what happens to the Cloudflare Pages in the near future.
