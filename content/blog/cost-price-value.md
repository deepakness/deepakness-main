> Cost and price are not the same.

## Cost

**Cost** is the amount that an organization spends to manufacture a product or to set up a service. It's the amount spent on the inputs like raw materials, rents, taxes, salaries, etc.

Cost doesn't include profit.

## Price

**Price** = Cost + Profit

When Profit is added to the Cost, it's called Price.

### Profit

> All profit is derived from RISK. - Peter Drucker

Indeed!

Profit is a reward for the risks taken in the business.

Profit is decided by taking below WHAT IFs (RISKS) into account:

- WHAT IF the customer changes their mind?
- WHAT IF they don't like the work?
- WHAT IF something unexpected happens?
- WHAT IF something changes midway through?

etc.

After considering all the possible risks, profit margin is increased which further increases the price of the product.

## Value

Seller determines price, but buyer determines value.

And, if buyers don't see any value in the product, they will NOT buy it - as simple as that.

[The Futur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zM2fB-Q8T7g) summarizes it in a beautiful way:

> When VALUE exceeds PRICE, buyers give you money.

That's it.

**Food for thought:**

When buyers ask for the cost, do they really mean cost or do they mean price?
