title: Do Not Make Fixed Plans
description: Because the future is unpredictable, it's not a good idea to have a fixed plan.

From the start, we have always been told to choose what we want to become in the future and to choose a plan for what we are going to do in the future.

> One sentence: the future is unpredictable.

The world is changing very fast and you just cannot always stick to the plan. Things become outdated and obsolete very quickly and it's not a good idea to have a fixed plan.

Let's look at the [example](https://blog.interactiveschools.com/blog/50-million-users-how-long-does-it-take-tech-to-reach-this-milestone) of the radio, television and internet: to reach an audience of 50 million, radio 38 years, television 13 years, and internet just 4 years. It does imply that the rate of change of the world itself is speeding up.

> Paul Graham [explains](http://paulgraham.com/hs.html), "it's not so important what you work on, so long as you're not wasting your time. Work on things that interest you and increase your options, and worry later about which you'll take."

Indeed! Having a different set of skills like writing, programming, painting, dancing does help in the long run as you can go in any direction depending upon the situation.

Taking my example, I completed my graduation in Mechanical Engineering but I also had an interest in writing, business, computers, programming, etc. and I kept learning about these too. And now, I'm completely into writing and other computers related things.

> Do not make fixed plans. **Make flexible plans.**

That's it.
