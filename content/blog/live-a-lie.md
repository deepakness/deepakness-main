Make yourself believe that 'the lie' is not a lie, and you will be able to happily live a lie.

For example, if you just have your laptop open on the desk and you're not working, still you can believe that you are working. Like, you can make yourself believe that you're

- making plans to start a new project, mentally
- thinking about your future plans, or
- examining the existence of your life, etc.

And, the fact that you're not doing anything on the laptop will be justified and you will easily live the lie.

So, am I advising you to live a lie?

Nope, I never said that.
