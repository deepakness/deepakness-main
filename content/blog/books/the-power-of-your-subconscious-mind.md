### You should have a clear cut idea about what you're gonna do

For example, if you get in a taxi and give a half dozen different directions to the driver, he'll get confused and probably will refuse to take you anywhere.

Same is while working with the Subconscious mind.

If you're not clear about your long-term or short-term goals, your subconscious mind will be confused and not assist you to achieve your goals.

### Use visualization as a way to exploit the placebo effect in your favor

Our minds are very powerful. It can make you do things that you wouldn't even imagine.

It can make you or it can break you.

The book talks about how to alter the placebo effect to take the maximum benefits from your subconscious mind.

###  If you canâ€™t decide between several options, take some time

Do not choose an option because you're not sure about other options. It's a bad practice.

Evaluate all the options and then decide what you have to go with.

### Do not envy anyone

No matter what they have done to you, do not envy them. It takes a significant amount of your energy in thinking about them, and then you actually lag behind.

Envy slows you down and restricts your imagination and thinking power. And, then subconscious also stops helping you.
